    <p class="body">When I started using AJAX I quickly hacked together some things that enjoyed the title AJAX.
    With other projects I found myself doing the same things over and over again. As all programmers I wanted a way
    to generalize some of this work.</p>

    <p class="body">But many of the things I had done just didn't fit the newer projects I was working on. So it
    seemed every project was about trying to get things to work with HTML/OS and also to work in a way that fit
    well with the HTML/OS concept.</p>

    <p class="body">If you were to google AJAX and read any of the definitions that you will find it really boils down
    to the idea that we do not have to reload the whole page every time something happens or some request is made. Often
    only a few elements need to change. This library attempts to solve this aspect of AJAX in a clean unobtrusive way.</p>

    <p class="body">So as I worked on these projects I found that several things started to surface. I came to the
    conclusion that a general library specifically written for HTML/OS was in order. Below is a list of what that libray
    attempts to do.</p>

    <p class="body">This library attempts to solve a few problems well, and does not attempt to do everything. Because
    of this an HTML/OS developer can use it with other libraries.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>I wanted a way to add AJAX without completely rebuilding my existing HTML/OS code.</li>
     <li>I wanted something that didn't require so much additional code that would turn my existing code into spaghetti code.</li>
     <li>I also needed a system that didn't care (and more importantly didn't break) if I was already using another library like Prototype, jquery, YUI, mootools, or whatever.</li>
     <li>I also wanted to have the ability to built sites that degrade nicely when Javascript is turned off.
    </ul>

    <p class="body">So CLEAR.js attempts to do these things. And there are no libraries built specifically for HTML/OS.</p>
    <p class="body">I decided that this library would focus on the delivery of parts of a page. I also decided that this
    delivery seemed to make the most sense if it came from an overlay.</p>

    <p class="body">Below is an example of how a link can become an ajax link, and how an overlay can become an ajax overlay.
    The following demo will degrade nicely and continue to work even without javascript.</p><br>

    <h2><center>CLEAR.js is currently in beta. I am currently adding it to much of my existing HTML/OS code. If you have a project you would like to try it on I would love to help. I want to make CLEAR.js even better. Contact me: riegel@clearimageonline.com</center></h2>
